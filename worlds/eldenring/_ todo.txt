er mod tools Smithbox, and Dark Script 3

Run python generate.py   need yaml in players
Or python launcher.py    so you can gen template options



Now I just need to label every single item :worry:


Need to make multiple item fillers like (smithing stone [1] x3, filler=True)

need to do dragon communion dragon defeat rules, shop is done




Ideas

gracesanity, graces are checks
option to turn off healing item randomiztion, start with
scadutree options, start with, not random, only within dlc, anywhere


dlc start / dlc only
only randomize key items in the pool, everything else randomized local  DO THIS!!!

Regional key ring (one key item per region unlocks all key doors in that region)
Regional keys (like the first one but per region)
